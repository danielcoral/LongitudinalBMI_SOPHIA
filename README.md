# Longitudinal BMI changes and its impact on risk biomarkers

Analysis of the impact of short-term weight changes on common clinical biomarkers

Aims:
1. What is the impact of short-term weight changes on common clinical biomarkers?
2. Is this impact independent of current BMI?
3. Does prior weight trajectory modify the effect of current BMI on clinical biomarkers?
4. Are these impacts the same in different age groups (adolescence, older individuals)?

Methods:
1. Estimation of average and individual variation of the 5-year trajectory of weight.
2. Estimation of the association of weight trajectory to common clinical biomarkers, including relevant interactions.
3. Validation in Rotterdam and ALSPAC.
